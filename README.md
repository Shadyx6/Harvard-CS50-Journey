Welcome to My CS50 Journey Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository, a digital chronicle of my journey through Harvard University's CS50, an introduction to computer science. This repository is not just a collection of code; it's a story of growth, challenges, and triumphs. As you navigate through it, you'll find my attempts, successes, and reflections on what has been an incredible learning adventure.

About CS50 CS50 is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. It's a course that challenges students to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.

What's Inside This Repo? This repository is structured to reflect all the hard work and dedication that went into completing the course.

ðŸ“˜ Problem Sets There are ten problem sets, each focusing on a different aspect of computer science, starting from the basics of C and gradually moving towards more complex topics like web development, finance, and security. Here's a quick overview:

Problem Set 1: C Basics - Hello, Mario, Cash Problem Set 2: Arrays - Readability, Caesar, Substitution Problem Set 3: Algorithms - Plurality, Runoff Problem Set 4: Memory - Filter, Recover Problem Set 5: Data Structures - Speller Problem Set 6: Python - Hello, Mario (Python), Cash (Python), Readability (Python), DNA Problem Set 7: SQL - Movies, Houses Problem Set 8: Web Track - Homepage Problem Set 9: Android Track (Optional) Additional Problem Sets: These include more challenging exercises that I took on to deepen my understanding. ðŸ”¬ Labs The nine labs provided hands-on experience with concepts before tackling the problem sets. They range from setting up a development environment to understanding the intricacies of web programming. Each lab is a building block towards mastering the course content.

ðŸš€ Final Project: Gadget Glory E-Commerce Website My CS50 final project, Gadget Glory, is an e-commerce platform dedicated to tech enthusiasts looking for the latest gadgets. This venture into web development allowed me to apply a comprehensive set of skills, bridging frontend aesthetics with backend functionality.

Project Highlights Core Features: User authentication, dynamic product listings, a shopping cart, and a secure checkout process. Tech Stack: Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive frontend, and Node.js for server-side logic. SQLite3 serves as the database backbone, ensuring efficient data handling. Learning Curve: Developing Gadget Glory challenged my understanding of web development, from ensuring user data security to crafting an intuitive user experience. Synopsis Gadget Glory stands as a testament to my journey through CS50, showcasing the practical application of coding skills in building a solution that caters to real-world needs. This project was not just about coding; it was about creating a platform that connects people with technology.

This streamlined version maintains the essential details about your project, Gadget Glory, focusing on its purpose, technical stack, and the challenges overcome during its development.

Reflections and Learnings Throughout this journey, I've encountered challenges that pushed me beyond what I thought was possible. Each problem set, lab, and the final project has taught me not only about programming but also about perseverance and the joy of solving problems. I've learned that asking for help, engaging with the community, and relentless persistence are key to overcoming obstacles.

How to Navigate This Repo Problem Sets: Located in the problem_sets directory, each subdirectory corresponds to a problem set. Labs: You can find the lab exercises in the labs directory, organized by week. Final Project: The final_project folder contains all the materials related to my final project, including code, documentation, and a reflective write-up. Gratitude I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the instructors and staff of CS50. Their dedication to creating an engaging, challenging, and supportive learning environment has been incredible. To my fellow CS50 students, your camaraderie and insights have been invaluable.
